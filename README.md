# Proxmox VDI Client (feat. Alpine Linux) Packer Script

## Acknlowledgements
This project was inspired by "apalrd's adventures" Youtube video "Netbooted Proxmox VDI Client(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TnP06K-gE&t=653s)"

Thanks is extended to John Patten the creator of PVE-VDIClient and without his application (https://github.com/joshpatten/PVE-VDIClient), this project would not have been possible.

## Todo
test run linux

## Command Line
As at Sept 2023, I tried to follow the guides from John and Apalrd and ran into some problems. Below is how I got to a running configuration. In a future iteration of this repository I will aim to make a packer file to automate this installation.
